[Type definitions](https://heseya.github.io/sdk-core/index.html)

## Features

- All Heseya API endpoints are exposed as methods on the SDK object.
- Full typing of all API responses and requests, as well as for the all Heseya models and enums.
- Automatic conversion between JSON and native types.
- Automatic handling request query parameters.
- Support for custom [Axios](https://www.npmjs.com/package/axios) instance.
- Helper functions and class for handling common tasks when creating e-commerce applications.

## Instalation

```bash
$ yarn add @heseya/store-core
// or
$ npm i @heseya/store-core
```

## Usage

### Type definitions

SDK package contains a set of type definitions for the Heseya API, you can import them directly into your project.

Full list of exported types corresponds to the SDK modules and it is available [here](https://heseya.github.io/sdk-core/index.html).

Each of the Heseya's Models has a corresponding type definition, with different type for the Model list, details, create and update methods.
The convention is following:

- `{ModelName}Listed` - type for the list of models
- `{ModelName}` - type for the details of a model
- `{ModelName}CreateDto` - type for the create method of a model
- `{ModelName}UpdateDto` - type for the update method of a model

Example for product types:

```ts
import { Product, ProductList, ProductCreateDto, ProductUpdateDto } from '@heseya/store-core'

const productCreateDto: ProductCreateDto = {
  ...
}

await heseya.Products.create(productCreateDto)
```

### Heseya Api Service

#### Initialization

You can initialize the API Service by calling the `createHeseyaApiService` function. It is important to pass the `axios` instance to the function.

Axios instance needs to be configured to use the URL of the Heseya API. Without it the SDK will not be able to make requests to the API.

```ts
import axios from 'axios'
import { createHeseyaApiService, HeseyaApiService } from '@heseya/store-core'

const axiosInstance = axios.create({ baseURL: 'https://api.example.com' })

const heseya: HeseyaApiService = createHeseyaApiService(axiosInstance)
```

##### Initialization in Nuxt.js

In nuxt, you can inject the service into the context. This allows you to use the service in your components. To do this you need to create the following plugin:

```typescript
import { Plugin } from '@nuxt/types'
import { createHeseyaApiService } from '@heseya/store-core'

const heseyaPlugin: Plugin = ({ $axios }, inject) => {
  inject('heseya', createHeseyaApiService($axios))
}

export default heseyaPlugin
```

#### Usage

Now, you can use the `HeseyaApiService` object to call the API for any of the endpoints.

For example, you can fetch all the products:

```ts
const products = await heseya.Products.get()
```

All the methods on the `HeseyaApiService` object return promises. If the request fails, the promise will be rejected with an default `AxiosError` object. This package provides a helper function to handle that errors `formatApiError`.

##### Authorization

The SDK does not provide any authorization. You need to implement your own authorization mechanism. To do this, you should use the `axios` instance that you injected into the `createHeseyaApiService` function. That instance needs to have interceptors configured to add the authorization header, as well as to handle the token refreshing.

To handle auth requests you can use methods from the `Auth` module.

### Auth Axios Enhancer

Package provides a helper function to handle everything related to the authorization. Thanks to it, you can modify the `axios` instance to add the authorization header, and to handle the token refreshing.

The instance modified in this way may be used in the `createHeseyaApiService` function.

```ts
import axios from 'axios'
import { enhanceAxiosWithAuthTokenRefreshing } from '@heseya/store-core'

const axiosInstance = enhanceAxiosWithAuthTokenRefreshing(axios.create(), {
  heseyaUrl: 'https://api.example.com',
  getAccessToken: () => localStorage.get('accessToken'),
  getRefreshToken: () => localStorage.get('refreshToken'),
  setAccessToken: (token: string) => localStorage.set('accessToken', token),
  setRefreshToken: (token: string) => localStorage.set('refreshToken', token),
  setIdentityToken: (token: string) => localStorage.set('identityToken', token),
  onTokenRefreshError: (error) => handleError(error),
  shouldIncludeAuthorizationHeader: (config) => config.url?.startsWith('/auth'),
})
```

Modified axios will try to refresh the access token every time the request fails with the `401` response code. If token refreshing will succeed, the request will be retried, otherwise axios will throw original error.

When token refreshing fails, not only the original error will be thrown, but also the `config.onTokenRefreshError` function will be called. You should use it to logout the user.

### Event bus

You can create an event bus to handle some events in your store. The main purpose of this feature is to create an abstract way to react to different actions that your client is performing in the store. For example, you can emit events to Google Analytics or to the Facebook Pixel.

#### Creating Event Bus

```ts
import { createHeseyaEventBusService } from '@heseya/store-core'

const eventBus = createHeseyaEventBusService()
```

#### Listening and emitting events

```ts
import { HeseyaEvent } from '@heseya/store-core'

// somewhere in your events config file
eventBus.on(HeseyaEvent.AddToCart, (product) => {
  gtm.emit('add_to_cart', { product_id: product.id })
})

// somewhere in your store code
eventBus.emit(HeseyaEvent.AddToCart, { id: '123' })
```
